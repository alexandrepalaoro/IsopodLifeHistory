# IsopodLifeHistory
Dataset and analyses of life history patterns of Netropical isopods (genus ATLANTOSCIA)

In the .csv files you will find the data used in our paper:

"size.csv" = file used to test whether species differed regarding cephalothorax width;
"fecundity.csv" = file used to test whether species differed in the number of eggs they carried;
"fertility.csv" = file used to test whether species differed in the number of embryos/mancas they carried;
"infectados.csv" = file used to test whether infected females carried more embryos/mancas than non-infected females;

Within those files, each row is a female and the columns are: 
"pop" column = the population where the individuals came from. pop1 = Bairro Agronomia; pop2 = Bairro Bel√©m Novo
"species" column = the three species we studied. ATLANTOSCIA FLORIDANA, PETRONIOI and INFLATA
"size.all", "size.fecund", "size.fert" = cephalothorax width of the individuals in mm
"eggs" = number of eggs that the female of that size was carrying;
"embryos" = number of embryos or manca that the female of that size was carrying;
"status" = whether the female was infected with WOLBACHIA or not.
